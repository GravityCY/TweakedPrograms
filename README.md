# All of my CC:T Programs
Welcome to the list of all my CC Programs,  

CC is a wonderful minecraft mod that adds programmable lua computers, some that are physically capable and some that are stationary computers.
## > Notable Programs
* Smart Storage  

> A program to make organizing a bunch of items a little bit easier, right now you declare 1 Inventory Type as the main storage.
* Storage Network

> Similar to Smart Storage but less unique and more utilitarian.
* Better Turtle

> A Library that has some useful turtle functions with the purpose of replacing the turtle functions.

* Map Program

> An attempt to creating a map of the players location.

* And **ALOT** of different libraries I've made that I thought were useful
